This is the README for Othello.

Anirudh:
Programmed Random player and Heuristics player, board.cpp configuration, combined herustics-minimax.

Preston:
Programmed minimax player and combined heuristics-minimax, added early/mid/late game.

We combined heuristics and minimax together and added early/mid/late game strategies.
Early game, our AI prioritizes mobility. Mid game, heurstics (corners and edges). Late game,
total number of dots on the board.
